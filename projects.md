# Projects

## McFall Fuel Ltd 2024 Customer Engagement Survey

I led the production of McFall Fuel’s 2024 Customer Engagement Survey in partnership with Kantar, the world’s leading marketing data and analytics company. I supervised two Summer interns in question development, collaborating closely with Kantar and our management team to define survey objectives, select recipients, and oversee distribution and progress tracking.

**Responsibilities:**
- Finalised survey questions and answer formats
- Set response targets and customer incentives
- Coordinated communication with internal teams and external customers

This project strengthened my skills in project management, stakeholder communication, and data analysis.

The objective of this project was to understand how competitors and industry stakeholders predict the evolution of the fuel market over the next 5, 10, and 15 years—critical for strategic planning by the CEO and Board.

- **Data Gathering & Cleaning:** Collected raw data from three sources and cleaned it to enable accurate comparison. Used McFall Fuel data from 2018–2023 and segmented it by sector to align with external benchmarks.
- **Analysis:** Compared company data with BEC scenarios ("Tui" representing government-led alternative energy adoption, and "Kea" representing consumer choice). Used error checks to validate all datasets.
- **Market Share Modelling:** Calculated current and modelled market share for McFall Fuel and compared against industry benchmarks, split by four main sectors and fuel types (diesel, petrol).
- **Stakeholder Collaboration:** Acted as primary liaison with PWC, leading meetings to ensure alignment and integrate feedback.
- **Deliverables:** Developed a user-friendly dashboard for the Board, including interactive features (e.g., percentage flex) to enable scenario analysis.

This project enhanced my expertise in data analysis, market research, stakeholder management, and strategic reporting.
